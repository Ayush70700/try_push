IAM - identity - giving roles and  permission.
- Mainly givn by security team

ec2 - elastic container - for data - like docker

cloud Registry - 

cloud trail - audit done,


aws config - user account assets, logs and monitering 

relation DS - for sequl DB

AWS org - 
S3 - build buckets for similar type of static data, 
-------------------------------------------------------------

3- tier normal - Web server - app server - DB
3-tier for cloud  - web server - lamda function (serverless) - DB


AWS CIS benchmarks.

foundation level - for all
normal foundation if only web application is there.

if only DB  - only for data base. 
if DB is included in testing. - data base + foundation

AWS compute is done for ec2 instances.
IF compute is for system then -  AWS compute service benchmark.
if compute is used by end user then - End user compute service

with tool only foundation is done, for rest of the checks - manual testing has to be done.

-------------------------------------------------------------
In AWS - least privileged is followed (where min. permission is given).

aws - 2 type user - root & IAM
no Access key is made for root user.

Req by clients:
no of AWS accounts and account number
How many regions - for calculation of  time and efforts.
creds of every account 
Permissions for each account.
	( console access - for manual audit steps,
	 progranatic access - for cli audit checks
	 VOA permission -  for viewing all resources- , 
	 securityAudit(SA) permission  -  for giving audit logs)

services in scope - deciding benchmarks/time & efforts estimation

-------------------------------------------------------------
1)INstall AWS
2)cli commands for cis 

 -> export AWS_access_key

-> prowler aws
-> prowler dashboard
